                This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However,
                the app may use third party code and libraries that use
                “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.
                You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies
                and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you
                choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some
                portions of this Service.

                of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
                storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
                guarantee its absolute security.
